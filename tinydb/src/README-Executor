Executor
---------------------
Will execute queries parsed in the form of query-struct.h. 

However it is not fully complete: 
1. The executor will always select *. 
2. When there is a comparison with a constant it can only be of type string. 

It can however handle multiple conditions in a correct way. 

There is an example query in the main function in executor.cpp. 

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To execute it:
*Run the Makefile in this folder
*execute ./main
